## Rust Version
In `rust_ver/src/main.rs` replace placeholders with you own account, change the channel.

## .NET Version
Currently we have only WPF application for Windows7 and later. Download from [release](https://github.com/artiga033/njtech_network_auto_auth/releases), and it's easy to go with GUI.
